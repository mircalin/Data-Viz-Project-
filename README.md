# Data Visualization Project

## Data
The data I propose to visualize for my project is a dataset of Spotify's Top 100 songs of 2018. These songs were ecollected using the Spotify Web API and the spotipy Python library. The following attributes will be evaluated: name, artists, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms 	time_signature. [The link to the data](https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018).

## Prototype:
I've created a proof of concept of this data. A visualization of student test scores based on background between male and female shows a significant trend. The data shows that there is a linear trend between the two. The odd trend is the data between male and female shows a difference in magnitude. Males are shown to have higher math scores than females. Females are shown to have higher writing and reading scores than males. 2 outliars are shown as female with parents with high school experience and the other with parents with some high school experience. Students with parents that did not finish a college degree showed very low scores. Students with parents that had some college had higher test scores.

## Questions and Tasks

The following questions are : 

* what are a few attributes that students receive different grades based on:
  * does test prep and student background affect student performance?
  * Specific conditions of the class?
  * Does test Preparation have a significant impact?

* Are there any trends in male & female test score?

* Does Parental level of education have an impact?

## Open Question
is there is any bias in the data between male and female?
