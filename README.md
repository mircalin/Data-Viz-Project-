# Data Visualization Project

## Data
The data I propose to visualize for my project is a dataset of Spotify's Top 100 songs of 2018. These songs were ecollected using the Spotify Web API and the spotify's Python library. What will the genre's of the songs predict? The following attributes will be evaluated: name, artists, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms 	time_signature. [The link to the data](https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018).

## Prototype:
A visualization showing the relationship between danceability and energy . The data shows that relatively high energy and high danceability are important to make hit song. The data also shows very few outliars for this dataset.

## Questions and Tasks

The following questions are : 

* Are the more popular songs danceable?
  * is there a range of energy for a song to be danceable.

* What do all of these songs have in common?
  * how much similarity and variation are in the data?

* why do people like these songs?
  * What does the majority of the population listen to?

## Open Question
* What does the distribution of the data look like?

* Would the top 100 dataset from 10 years ago correlate well with the current data set?

## Schedule of Deliverables

Danceability of the data:                     Due-10/23/19

Similarity in songs:                          Due-10/23/19

Population interest:                          Due-10/23/19

## Findings 
Looking into the dataset a bit closer, there seems to be a small restriction in the duration of music, there is only one outlier exceeding over the 6.5-minute mark. Could this change be overly popular in the media to have an average length for music or is a demand from Spotify to use less bandwidth for streaming purposes.
