# Data Visualization Project

## Data
The data I propose to visualize for my project is a dataset of Spotify's Top 100 songs of 2018. These songs were ecollected using the Spotify Web API and the spotify Python library. The following attributes will be evaluated: name, artists, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms 	time_signature. [The link to the data](https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018).

## Prototype:
A visualization showing the relationship between danceability and energy . The data shows that relatively high energy and high danceability are important to make hit song. THe data also shows very few outliars for this dataset.

## Questions and Tasks

The following questions are : 

* Are the more popular songs danceable?
  * is there a range of energy for a song to be danceable.

* What do all of these songs have in common?
  * how much variation is in the data?

* why do people like these songs?
  * What does the majority of the population listen to
